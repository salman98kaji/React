TodoForm-->

The 'addTodo'= function adds a new "todo" item to the todos state by updating it with a new array that includes the new item at the beginning. It takes a todo object as an argument, which represents the new item to add. Using setTodos, the function updates the state with a callback that receives the previous state (prev) and returns a new array. This new array starts with a newly created object that combines a unique id (generated using Date.now()) and the properties of the passed todo object (...todo), followed by the previous todos (...prev). For example, if the initial state is an empty array and addTodo({text: "Learn React", completed: false}) is called, the state is updated to include a new item like {id: 1234567890, text: "Learn React", completed: false} at the beginning. Repeated calls will prepend new items while retaining the previous ones in the array.

The 'updateTodo'= function updates a specific todo item in the todos state by replacing it with a new todo object based on its id. It takes two arguments: the id of the todo to update and the updated todo object. Using setTodos, it updates the state by calling a callback that receives the previous state (prev) and returns a new array. This array is created by mapping over the previous todos (prev.map), where each prevTodo is checked against the provided id. If the id matches, the prevTodo is replaced with the new todo object; otherwise, the original prevTodo is kept unchanged. For example, if the current state contains {id: 1, text: "Learn React", completed: false} and updateTodo(1, {id: 1, text: "Learn React", completed: true}) is called, the state is updated by replacing the matching item with the new one while leaving all other todos unchanged.

The 'deleteTodo'= function removes a specific todo item from the todos state based on its id. It takes a single argument, id, which identifies the todo to be deleted. Using setTodos, it updates the state by calling a callback that receives the previous state (prev) and returns a new array created by filtering out the todo with the matching id. The filter method iterates over the prev array, and for each prevTodo, it includes it in the new array only if its id is not equal to the provided id. For example, if the current state contains [{id: 1, text: "Learn React"}, {id: 2, text: "Build a Todo App"}] and deleteTodo(1) is called, the state is updated to remove the todo with id: 1, resulting in a new state of [{id: 2, text: "Build a Todo App"}].

The 'toggleComplete'= function toggles the completed status of a specific todo item in the todos state based on its id. It takes a single argument, id, which identifies the todo to update. Using setTodos, it updates the state by calling a callback that receives the previous state (prev) and returns a new array. This array is created by mapping over prev, where each prevTodo is checked against the provided id. If the id matches, the prevTodo is updated by spreading its properties ({...prevTodo}) and flipping its completed status (completed: !prevTodo.completed). If the id does not match, the original prevTodo is returned unchanged. For example, if the current state contains [{id: 1, text: "Learn React", completed: false}] and toggleComplete(1) is called, the state is updated to [{id: 1, text: "Learn React", completed: true}], toggling the completed property.

This useEffect hook initializes the todos state by loading saved todos from localStorage when the component first mounts. The hook runs only once because of the empty dependency array ([]). Inside the effect, it retrieves a value from localStorage using localStorage.getItem('todos'), which returns a JSON string if todos exist. This string is parsed back into an array using JSON.parse. If the parsed array (todos) exists and is not empty (todos && todos.length > 0), the setTodos function is called to update the state with the loaded todos. This ensures that any previously saved todos are restored into the app when it reloads or starts. For example, if localStorage contains [{id: 1, text: "Learn React", completed: false}], this effect will initialize the todos state with this array when the component renders for the first time.

This useEffect hook automatically saves the current todos state to localStorage whenever the todos state changes. The dependency array [todos] ensures the effect runs only when todos is updated. Inside the effect, the todos state is converted to a JSON string using JSON.stringify(todos) and stored in localStorage with the key 'todos' using localStorage.setItem. This keeps the todos data persistent across page reloads by saving the latest state to the browser's storage. For example, if the todos state changes to [{id: 1, text: "Learn React", completed: false}], this effect will store that array in localStorage as a string, ensuring it can be retrieved later.

TodoItem-->

The 'editTodo' function updates a specific todo item and exits the editing mode. It calls the updateTodo function, passing the id of the todo to be updated and a new object that spreads the existing todo properties while replacing the todo text with the updated value (todoMsg). This ensures all properties, such as id and completed, remain unchanged except for the modified text. After updating the todo, it sets isTodoEditable to false using setIsTodoEditable(false), disabling the edit mode and switching the UI back to the normal view. For example, if the original todo is {id: 1, todo: "Learn React", completed: false} and todoMsg is "Learn Advanced React", the function updates the todo and exits edit mode.

The 'editToggle' function toggles the completed status of a specific todo item by calling the toggleComplete function with the id of the todo. The todo.id identifies which todo in the list should have its completed property updated. When executed, toggleComplete flips the value of completed from true to false or vice versa. For example, if the todo is {id: 1, todo: "Learn React", completed: false}, calling editToggle will update it to {id: 1, todo: "Learn React", completed: true}, effectively marking it as complete.
