"# React" 

React has two libraries. React-dom and React-native. If we want to work on web applications use react and react-dom libraries. If we want to work on mobile apps use react and react-native. 
npx = node package executor.
create-react-app = utility
vite = its a bundler which doesnot have unnecessary packages and files, and thus takes less time to open. 
Framework vs Library = framework has a strict set rules which we have to follow, whereas library give us a lose hand and we can work freely.
<>Fragment tag</> 
Always keep component/function name must be capital.
If your js files returns html tags then always use .jsx. 
Virtual DOM is the lightweight javascript representation of the actual DOM in the browser.  
Analogy for virtual DOM=
Think of the virtual DOM as a blueprint or an architect's plan:
Instead of rebuilding the entire house (the actual DOM) when making changes, you first update the blueprint (virtual DOM), compare it to the previous blueprint, and then make only the necessary adjustments to the house.
Reconciliation = The algorithm that react uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed. 
One tree is the browser DOM tree that is the actual DOM and the other tree is the reactroot tree ie; the virtual DOM tree
