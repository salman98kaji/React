'AuthService' class, which acts as an abstraction layer between your application and the Appwrite authentication service. It manages all operations related to user authentication, including account creation, login, fetching the current user, and logout.

When the AuthService class is instantiated:--
1.The constructor sets up 'this.client' with the correct API endpoint and project ID.
2.The 'this.account' instance is initialized, enabling access to Appwrite's account management features.
Once initialized, the 'AuthService object' can be used to interact with Appwrite seamlessly, leveraging the configured endpoint and project.

Appwrite Databases let you store and query structured data. Databases provide high-performance and scalable data storage for your key application, business, and user data. You can organize data into databases, collections, and documents. You can also paginate, order, and query documents. For complex business logic, Appwrite supports relationships to help you model your data.

Appwrite 'Storage' allows you to manage files in your project. You can use it to store images, videos, documents, and other files for your projects. It provides APIs to upload, download, delete, and list files, with many added utilities.

The 'async' keyword is used to define an asynchronous function.An asynchronous function always returns a Promise.It allows the use of await within the function, making it easier to work with asynchronous operations (like API calls) in a cleaner, synchronous-looking way.
The 'await' keyword is used inside an async function to pause the execution of the function until a Promise is resolved or rejected.It simplifies handling asynchronous code, avoiding callback hell or chaining .then() and .catch().

slug: Serves as the document's unique ID, potentially used for generating meaningful URLs. This suggests itâ€™s being used as the unique ID for the post in the Appwrite database. (Appwrite allows custom IDs for documents.)
