# React + Vite

The <form> element is used to gather user input, such as text fields, checkboxes, and buttons. In a React application, it often wraps other elements that accept user data.
onSubmit={(e) => { ... }}: This is an event handler attached to the onSubmit event of the form. The onSubmit event is triggered when the user submits the form (usually by clicking a submit button or pressing the Enter key while a form field is focused). e is the event object that is automatically passed to the event handler function when the event is triggered. It contains information about the event (like the element that triggered it, the type of event, etc.).
e.preventDefault();: By default, when a form is submitted, the page reloads. To prevent this default behavior and allow you to handle the form submission using JavaScript (without refreshing the page), e.preventDefault() is called. This ensures that the form submission does not trigger a page reload or refresh, allowing the app to handle the submission in a custom way (like making an API request or updating the state).
'Custom hooks' = in React allow you to reuse logic across multiple components. Code reusebility: custom hooks let you extract reusable logic that can be shared among different components. For example, if multiple components need to fetch data from an API, instead of duplicating the fetch logic, you can create a custom hook (useFetch) and reuse it. Separato of concerns: Custom hooks helps separate UI logic(like rendering) from business or data logic(like fetching data and managing state). Before a custom hook: All logic is directly inside the component, making it large and harder to maintain. After a custom hook: Encapsulate the logic in a hook, keeping the component focused on rendering.
The <select> tag in HTML is used to create a dropdown list that allows users to choose one or multiple options from a predefined list. It works by grouping a set of <option> elements, each representing an individual item in the dropdown.The <option> elements: Define the choices in the dropdown. Each option has:-- value: Represents the data sent to the server when the form is submitted. Text content: What the user sees in the dropdown.
The useId hook in React is used to generate unique IDs that can be used in your components. It ensures that these IDs are stable, even during server-side rendering (SSR) or when components re-render. It creates unique IDs that can be used for associating elements like form inputs and labels, ensuring accessibility. The useId hook generates a stable ID (e.g., :r0:input) which is used to associate the <label> with the <input> via the htmlFor attribute.
The htmlFor attribute in HTML and React is used to associate a <label> element with a form control, such as an <input>. The value of the htmlFor attribute should match the id of the associated form control. When they match.Clicking the <label> element moves the focus to the associated form control. Screen readers can recognize the connection, which improves accessibility.
